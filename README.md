# Number_Gassing_game
"This repository contains a Java program for a Number Guessing Game implemented using Swing and JFrame. Players can guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 and receive feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This project serves as a basic example of using Java Swing for graphical user interface development."
